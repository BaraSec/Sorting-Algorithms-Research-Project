# Sorting Algorithms' Research Project

This was my solution to a Data Structures course's fourth 'research' project in a CS Bachelor program I am pursuing. It's a Sorting Algorithms Research project. I've chosen to study the following sorting algorithms: 

  A. Counting Sort<br />
  B. Bucket Sort<br />
  C. Comb Sort<br />
  D. Odd-Even Sort<br />
  E. Cocktail sort<br />



The project's description that was sent to the course's students is available at `Description/COMP242 - Project4.pdf`.
